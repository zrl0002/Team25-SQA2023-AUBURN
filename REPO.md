We collectively worked towards setting up Git Hooks to allows us to report secuirty weaknesses. Along with the hooks, we set up a fuzz.py file to test methods throughout kubesec.
This is automatically called along with any changes that happen in a .py file.
We have learned how running .py files in git hooks works as well as the forensics.
